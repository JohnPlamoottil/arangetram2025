## History of Bharatanatyam
Bharatanatyam is one of the most ancient forms of classical Indian dances, expressed through Nritta (rhythmic movements), Nritya (expression), and Natya (mime). It is a classical dance style from South India known for its grace, rhythm, and sculpturesque poses. This classical dance had its origins thousands of years ago in the Natya Sastra, a comprehensive guide to the intricacies of dance, drama and music written by the sage Bharata. In the word Bharata are the three components of the dance: Bha for Bhava (expression), Ra for Raaga (melody), and Ta for Taala (rhythm). Bharatanatyam is unique in its use of geometric precision, rhythmic complexity, and a distinctive language of gestures. By combining these elements with music, Bharatanatyam expresses the yearning of the human soul for union with the eternal.

## History of Arangetram
Arangetram is a Tamil word, which means the ‘etram’ or ascending on the ‘arangam’ or performance on stage by a dancer. In this concert-length solo recital to the public, a dancer presents a full repertoire of dances (Maargam), demonstrating extensive knowledge of the art form through a variety of pieces, keeping a balance between “nritta and nritya”. To reach this juncture in the career of a dancer requires years of intense and rigorous training. The Arangetram is the first step in the transition from an amateur to a professional dancer.

## Quote
“In a society that worships love, freedom and beauty, dance is sacred. It is a prayer for the future, a remembrance of the past and a joyful exclamation of thanks for the present.” 
- Amelia Atwater-Rhodes

” Yatho Hasta Thatho Drishti, Yatho Drishti “
"Where the hands(hasta) are, go the eyes (drishti); where the eyes are, goes the mind (manah); where the mind goes, there is an expression of inner feeling (bhava) and where there is bhava, mood or sentiment (rasa) is evoked”
