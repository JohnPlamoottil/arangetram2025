Shishya memoires: Parents Shishya for their Daughter

Michelle’s Parents Shishya
Watching Michelle grow into the graceful, confident young woman she is today has been one of our greatest joys. From her first dance class at age six to this day, her Arangetram, we have seen her dedication, resilience, and passion shine through. Dance has shaped her in so many ways—teaching her discipline, patience, and how to express herself with strength and grace.
We are incredibly proud of her journey, not just as a dancer but as a kind, determined individual who balances so much with heart and focus. This milestone is a reflection of years of commitment, and we are so grateful to her guru, Jinoo Varghese, for guiding her with wisdom and care.
Michelle, we love you deeply and are so proud of you. May you continue to dance through life with the same joy and purpose.
— With love,Amma and Appa

Rose’s Bharatanayam Bio: 

Rose Thomas, a dedicated Bharatanatyam dancer, found passion in dance at the age of 5. She started her journey at Soorya Dance School under the careful guidance of Guru Smt. Jinoo Varghese. 

Over the years, Rose explored many forms of art in various ways. She learned a cinematic style of dance with the guidance of her teacher, Varsha Vijayan. Additionally, she followed her passion for music when she became a member of her church choir. The focus and time management skills she has developed through both music and dance have shaped her approach to academics and life, helping her balance high-level commitments with confidence.

In addition to her artistic pursuits, as a rising junior Rose is a student leader at Stevenson High School with a strong record of service and involvement. As a two-year Class Board Representative, she has played a key role in shaping her school community by helping organize student events, including dances, spirit weeks, and unity-building activities. Rose serves as a Student Led Activities Leader, where she helps facilitate student engagement school wide. Academically, she is a Science Olympiad two-time state qualifier, and actively involved in service through Future Doctors of America, where she builds her passion for the field of medicine. Moreover, Rose has been inducted as a member of the National Honor Society. 

With the blessings of God, the guidance of her guru, and the unwavering support of her family and friends, Rose’s dedication to dance has led her to this milestone—completing her Arangetram today.

Amarya’s Bharatanayam bio:

Amarya, a sixteen-year-old passionate Bharatanatyam dancer, began her journey at the age of five under the guidance of Guru Smt. Jinoo Varghese at the Soorya Dance School. Over the years, her love for dance has flourished as she trained in cinematic dance under Varsha Vijayan. 
Dance has been a powerful expression of her culture, creativity, and identity. She has become disciplined and confident, learning how to balance all her responsibilities with grace. Above all, dance has taught her the importance of friendship, community, and self-growth.
A rising junior at Stevenson High School, Amarya is a dedicated student leader. She serves on her class board and soon begins her term as Class Vice President. Beyond school, she is a two-year representative on her church’s youth council and assists with its social media content to inform and engage the community.
Academically, Amarya has been fond of science and participates in clubs such as Science Olympiad and HOSA. She is also a member of Best Buddies and volunteers at her high school’s preschool program. Her love for working with children and medicine has encouraged her to pursue a career as a pediatrician.
Whether on stage or in service, Amarya approaches every commitment with passion and purpose. Dance continues to be an inspiring force in her life, and she plans to pursue it beyond her arangetram, using it as a way to both honor her heritage and evolve as an artist. Amarya is proud to showcase her years of dedication and work that were poured into today’s performance.

Jenna Bharatanayam bio: 

Jenna's journey with Bharatanatyam has been deeply interlaced with her personal growth and development. 
She joined  Soorya Dance School at the age of four with the continuing  leadership under the guidance  of  Guru Smt. Jinoo Varghese. 
Through Bharatanayam, Jenna has learned to express emotions in such a way that words sometimes cannot. 
Through this journey, she gained a profound appreciation for the significance of tradition, mythology, and story-telling that has enriched her life outside of dance. 
As she continues her studies, Jenna found that the life lessons from Bharatanatyam such as resilience, discipline, and dedication are  just as important in her academic and personal life.
Her performances at social events including the  Chicago Malayalee Association, Kalashastra, Onam festivals, and Flowers TV  are milestones in her journey.
Every performance reflects a celebration of her culture and a reminder of how far she achieved as both a dancer and an individual. 
Outside of dance, Jenna is a upcoming  sophomore at Warren Township High School where she is involved in other extracurriculars like track and field. Jenna uses the concepts and ideologies of Bharatanatyam in all that she does. 
Whether it is her diligence in academics or her contributions to the church youth groups, her disciplined mindset and determination stem directly from her dance training.
 The art of dance has not only improved her performance but also helped her get  leadership roles in her life.
Jenna has the opportunity here to choreograph various dances allowing her to connect better with others, especially when organizing activities for the  younger generation. 
Looking into the  future,  Bharatanatyam will continue to  shape her identity and empower her to approach each new chapter with the same passion and commitment that she discovered with classical dance. With the support from her family/ friends and especially her guru, she has the opportunity to  complete her arangetram today!

Jennas Shishya

Andreas mom note to her! Shilpa and Jeril:

Watching our Andrea grow has been one of the greatest joys of our lives. From her earliest days, she has carried a quiet strength and a soft heart — gentle in nature, yet bold in spirit. She is calm and composed in public, but in the company of those she loves, her playful, mischievous side shines through. Among her closest friends, she is loud, confident, and full of life — never afraid to speak her mind and lift others up.

She gives selflessly, often putting others’ happiness before her own. Whether it's a toy, time, or a piece of her favorite treat, she never hesitates to share. At home, she’s the cool big sister — teasing, laughing, and playing endlessly with her little brother, finding joy in simply being with him (and often in annoying him too!). She is soft-spoken but firm, kind but fearless — a beautiful balance that makes her truly special.

Dance has been a constant in her life — a space where her inner world comes alive. Over the years, it has helped her find grace, discipline, and deep connection to tradition. Through every movement and every expression, we see her love for the art and the quiet dedication behind it.

As parents, we feel truly blessed to watch her grow into the young woman she is — full of heart, full of spirit, and full of promise.

With love and pride,
Appa & Amma
