            {" "}
            The history of Indian dance is a rich tapestry woven with spiritual,
            cultural, and artistic traditions that span thousands of years. Its
            roots trace back to pre-Vedic times and are formalized in the Natya
            Shastra, an ancient Sanskrit treatise attributed to Bharata Muni,
            which laid the foundation for Indian classical dance and drama by
            defining essential elements like nritta (pure dance), nritya
            (expressive dance), and natya (dramatic storytelling). <br />
            <br />
            Traditionally, dance was a sacred offering performed in temples by
            devadasis, women who dedicated their lives to spiritual service
            through movement. Over time, distinct classical dance styles emerged
            across India, each reflecting regional culture, language, and
            devotion. <br />
            <br />
            There are eight officially recognized classical forms: Bharatanatyam
            (Tamil Nadu), Kathak (North India), Kathakali and Mohiniyattam
            (Kerala), Kuchipudi (Andhra Pradesh), Odissi (Odisha), Manipuri
            (Manipur), and Sattriya (Assam). Each style combines intricate
            gestures, facial expressions, rhythm, and costume to convey
            stories—often rooted in mythology and devotion. <br />
            <br />
            Alongside these classical styles, India’s folk and tribal dances add
            vibrant color and diversity, often performed during festivals,
            harvests, and community events. Dances like Bhangra and Giddha from
            Punjab, Garba and Dandiya from Gujarat, Lavani from Maharashtra,
            Ghoomar from Rajasthan, and Chhau from Eastern India reflect the
            everyday life, spirit, and joy of the people. <br />
            <br />
            In modern times, Indian dance has evolved with global influences,
            especially through the Indian film industry. Bollywood dance, for
            example, merges classical, folk, and Western styles into a
            high-energy, expressive form that has gained worldwide popularity.
            Contemporary Indian dancers often blend ballet, hip hop, and modern
            dance with traditional forms, creating new expressions of cultural
            identity. Today, Indian dance thrives not only on stage and screen
            but also in global classrooms and festivals, showcasing the
            country's profound artistic heritage. From sacred temple rituals to
            international performances, Indian dance continues to be a dynamic
            and powerful form of storytelling and expression.
