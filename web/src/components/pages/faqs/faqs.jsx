          What is Bharatanatyam?
        </button>
        <div className="panel">
          <p>
            Bharatanatyam is one of the most ancient forms of classical Indian
            dances, expressed through Nritta (rhythmic movements), Nritya
            (expression), and Natya (mime). It is a classical dance style from
            South India known for its grace, rhythm, and sculpturesque poses.
            This classical dance had its origins thousands of years ago in the
            Natya Sastra, a comprehensive guide to the intricacies of dance,
            drama and music written by the sage Bharata. In the word Bharata are
            the three components of the dance: Bha for Bhava (expression), Ra
            for Raaga (melody), and Ta for Taala (rhythm). Bharatanatyam is
            unique in its use of geometric precision, rhythmic complexity, and a
            distinctive language of gestures. By combining these elements with
            music, Bharatanatyam expresses the yearning of the human soul for
            union with the eternal.

          What is an Arangetram?
        </button>
        <div className="panel">
          <p>
            Arangetram is a Tamil word, which means the ‘etram’ or ascending on
            the ‘arangam’ or performance on stage by a dancer. In this
            concert-length solo recital to the public, a dancer presents a full
            repertoire of dances (Maargam), demonstrating extensive knowledge of
            the art form through a variety of pieces, keeping a balance between
            “nritta and nritya”. To reach this juncture in the career of a
            dancer requires years of intense and rigorous training. The
            Arangetram is the first step in the transition from an amateur to a
            professional dancer. This dance is a debut performance of a dance
            form given by a student who has trained for many years.

            Your prescence is the greatest gift to the hosts. In some events, a
            non-profit cause is designated by the performer. You may choose to
            donate to that cause but there is no obligation to do so.

          How long is each dance item?
        </button>
        <div className="panel">
          <p>
            Each dance item is roughly 10 minutes in duration. the"varnum"
            (centerpiece) is longer - closer to 40minutes. Overall, expect the
