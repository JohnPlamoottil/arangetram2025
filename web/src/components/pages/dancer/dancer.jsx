    autobio: `Michelle has been dancing since the age of six, exploring a variety of 
              styles including Bharatanatyam, Cinematic, and Western dance. She began her dance 
              journey under Chinu Thottam, where she took her first steps into the world of dance. 
              In third grade, she began her formal training in Bharatanatyam under Jinoo Varghese, 
              who has played an important role in developing her growth both as a dancer and a person. 
              Through Bharatanatyam, Michelle discovered a deeper connection to her cultural identity 
              and embraced the values of discipline, dedication, and responsibility. Her love for dance 
              has given her the opportunity to perform at several events, including Flowers TV USA, CMA, 
              Kalakshetra, and other competitions. Michelle is currently a student at Wheeling High School 
              and will be entering 11th grade this fall. Outside of dance, she is actively involved in 
              Track, Flag Football, ASA, and NHS. For Michelle, dance is where she feels the 
              most confident and free. 
              It’s something that brings her joy and helps her be her true self. 
              Today’s Arangetram represents a significant milestone in her life, a celebration of her hard work, 
              passion for the art, and heartfelt gratitude to her teacher, family, and all who have supported 
              her along the way. `,

              she is today has been one of our greatest joys. From her first
              dance class at age six to this day, her Arangetram, we have seen
              her dedication, resilience, and passion shine through. Dance has
              shaped her in so many ways—teaching her discipline, patience, and
              how to express herself with strength and grace. We are incredibly
              proud of her journey, not just as a dancer but as a kind,
              determined individual who balances so much with heart and focus.
              This milestone is a reflection of years of commitment, and we are
              so grateful to her guru, Jinoo Varghese, for guiding her with
              wisdom and care. Michelle, we love you deeply and are so proud of
              you. May you continue to dance through life with the same joy and

    solo: `Durgae Durgae" is a devotional piece in praise of Goddess Durga,
              the fierce yet compassionate protector of the universe. 
              The choreography highlights Durga’s divine form: her eighteen golden hands,
              her thousand eyes, her thousand names, and vividly portrays her holding 
              sacred weapons like the conch, discus, bow, and arrow, seated majestically upon a lion. 
              The piece also brings to life the battle between Durga and Mahishasura, 
              culminating in the slaying of the demon king. 
              Additionally, it celebrates Durga as the embodiment of both strength 
              and beauty, with her graceful, fish-shaped eyes. 
              The item concludes with the poet, Madurai Krishnan, offering his
              salutations to the goddess, seeking her blessings for protection,
              strength, and victory over all obstacles.  
              Set to Ragam Revathi and Adi Talam, this piece blends devotion, valor, and
              grace into one powerful performance.`,

              In addition to Bharatanatyam, Andrea is also trained in cinematic, ballet, and hip hop dance styles, allowing her to explore movement across cultures and genres.
              Andrea also has a deep love for music and performance. She plays the violin, electric guitar, and electric bass, and draws inspiration from a wide range of musical styles—fueling her creativity and sense of rhythm in unexpected ways.
              Andrea is also a student-athlete, proudly representing her school as a varsity wrestler—a testament to her discipline, resilience, and drive both on and off the mat. As an active participant in school cultural events, she continues to balance her artistic and athletic passions with grace, commitment, and enthusiasm.
              Driven by a strong desire to make a difference, Andrea aspires to pursue a career in the medical field, where she hopes to explore meaningful ways to help and serve humanity. Her compassion, curiosity, and sense of purpose are at the heart of everything she does.

`,
    shishya: `Watching our Andrea grow has been one of the greatest joys of our lives. From her earliest days, she has carried a quiet strength and a soft heart — gentle in nature, yet bold in spirit. She is calm and composed in public, but in the company of those she loves, her playful, mischievous side shines through. Among her closest friends, she is loud, confident, and full of life — never afraid to speak her mind and lift others up.
              She gives selflessly, often putting others’ happiness before her own. Whether it's a toy, time, or a piece of her favorite treat, she never hesitates to share. At home, she’s the cool big sister — teasing, laughing, and playing endlessly with her little brother, finding joy in simply being with him (and often in annoying him too!). She is soft-spoken but firm, kind but fearless — a beautiful balance that makes her truly special.
              Dance has been a constant in her life — a space where her inner world comes alive. Over the years, it has helped her find grace, discipline, and deep connection to tradition. Through every movement and every expression, we see her love for the art and the quiet dedication behind it.
              As parents, we feel truly blessed to watch her grow into the young woman she is — full of heart, full of spirit, and full of promise.

She joined Soorya Dance School at the age of four with the continuing leadership under the guidance of Guru Smt. Jinoo Varghese.
Through Bharatanayam, Jenna has learned to express emotions in such a way that words sometimes cannot.
Through this journey, she gained a profound appreciation for the significance of tradition, mythology, and story-telling that has enriched her life outside of dance.
As she continues her studies, Jenna found that the life lessons from Bharatanatyam such as resilience, discipline, and dedication are just as important in her academic and personal life.
Her performances at social events including the Chicago Malayalee Association, Kalashastra, Onam festivals, and Flowers TV are milestones in her journey.
Every performance reflects a celebration of her culture and a reminder of how far she achieved as both a dancer and an individual.
Outside of dance, Jenna is a upcoming sophomore at Warren Township High School where she is involved in other extracurriculars like track and field. Jenna uses the concepts and ideologies of Bharatanatyam in all that she does.
Whether it is her diligence in academics or her contributions to the church youth groups, her disciplined mindset and determination stem directly from her dance training.
The art of dance has not only improved her performance but also helped her get leadership roles in her life.
Jenna has the opportunity here to choreograph various dances allowing her to connect better with others, especially when organizing activities for the younger generation.
Looking into the future, Bharatanatyam will continue to shape her identity and empower her to approach each new chapter with the same passion and commitment that she discovered with classical dance. With the support from her family/ friends and especially her guru, she has the opportunity to complete her arangetram today!`,

Watching her grow into the young woman she is today has been one of our greatest blessings. She has always approached life with sincerity and grace, and nowhere is that more beautifully expressed than through her dance.
Jenna was always intrigued with dance, and at the young age of 4, she began her dance training. She went through many ups and downs, but overcame every obstacle and setback that came in her way. A memory of Jenna that I will always hold dear to my heart was at her first dance showcase. She performed her best but at the end of the show she came running to me, in tears because of a stomach ache. Despite the discomfort, all she needed was a quick hug and she was all smiles. At that moment, I knew my daughter was destined for greatness. 
As we sit in the audience today, watching Jenna perform her arangetram, our hearts are full—with immense pride, love, and gratitude. This moment is more than a milestone; it is 11 years of sacrifice, hard work, immense dedication and deep passion for Bharatanatyam.
We still remember your very first dance class—tiny feet, much excitement, and an uncertain namaskaram at the age of 4 and a half. From those early steps to the confident rhythm of your footwork today, your journey has been nothing but extraordinary. Along the way, dance has become more than an art form—it has been a way of life. It has shaped your identity by teaching you resilience, and helping you create a deeper connection with your Indian roots.
Through every dance class, every sore muscle, and every late night spent perfecting your dance style, has paved the path to this very moment! Behind the elegance we see today lies a journey of discipline, sacrifice, and quiet perseverance. You have shown us what it means to pursue something with your whole heart, and in doing so, you have inspired us more than you know.
We are endlessly thankful to her beloved guru, Jinoo Varghese, whose guidance, patience, and unwavering belief in her has played an invaluable role in this journey. She has nurtured not only her dance, but her spirit, and we are forever grateful.
To our dear family and friends—thank you for walking this path with us. Whether it was driving to classes, encouraging her through tough rehearsals, or simply cheering her on—you have been part of her story in more ways than you know.
And to our daughter Jenna, Watching you grow over the past 11 years has been the most blessed journey. We thank God for blessing us with you, and for the wonderful person that you are. We cannot begin to explain how proud we are of you, for being able to manage your extreme dance schedule with school, sports, clubs, and all church related activities. You have become a wonderful leader, both confident and capable. Through your leadership, we see your heart, your strength, and your love for this beautiful tradition. Dance has given you a wonderful foundation, and we hope that as you continue to grow, you use those values and teachings in everything you do. May your feet always find rhythm, and your soul always find joy in the dance. Your grace on stage is matched only by your humility. 
You have not only honored the tradition—you have made it your own, and through your expression, you have given all of us a glimpse of something timeless and divine. Never forget how far you have come, how deeply you are loved, and how brightly your light shines.

    solo: `This is a Christian composition based on the famous Malayalam poem "Magdalena Mariam", written by Mahakavi Vallathol Narayana Menon. The piece highlights the early part of Mary Magdalene's life, focusing on her past as a sinner. It depicts the powerful moment when Mary is brought before Jesus after being condemned and stoned by the crowd. As Jesus begins to write on the ground with his finger, he turns the judgment back on the accusers, saying, "Let him who is without sin cast the first stone." This act of mercy and justice marks a pivotal moment in Mary's life, leading her to repentance as she surrenders at Jesus's feet. The item beautifully portrays Mary’s transformation, capturing the depth of her remorse and the grace of forgiveness granted by Christ. Through expressive movements, the dancer conveys Mary’s inner struggle, her redemption, and the purity of Jesus's compassion. Set in Ragamalika and Talamalika`,
