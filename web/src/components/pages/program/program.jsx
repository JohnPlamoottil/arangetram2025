              Namaskaram, On behalf of Soorya Dance School and our teacher
              Smt.Jinoo Varghese, I take immense pleasure in presenting to you
              today - Samarpanam. We commence our Arangetram with a
              ‘Pushpanjali’ - The word ‘Anjali’ means ‘an offering’, Pushpanjali
              is an offering of flowers by the dancer. It is an invocation piece
              done at the beginning of a performance. This item is unique as
              this is in praise of Mother Mary, as we humbly seek your blessings
              for a smooth performance today, as we come to you for guidance and
              knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pushpanjali, meaning “offering of flowers,” is the traditional
              invocatory piece that begins a Bharatanatyam Margam. In this item,
              the dancer offers flowers as a mark of respect to the deity, the
              guru, the musicians, and the audience. Set to a lively rhythm,
              Pushpanjali combines graceful movements and rhythmic footwork,
              invoking divine blessings for an auspicious beginning. It sets the
              tone for the performance that follows, symbolizing devotion,
              humility, and the dancer’s readiness to embark on a sacred
              artistic journey. <br />

              ‘Pradosha Samayadi’ is a vibrant composition that describes the
              dance of Lord Shiva during Pradosha Samaya (bimonthly occasion on
              the thirteenth day of every fortnight in the Hindu calendar).The
              composer describes His Tandava in a very spectacular way and talks
              about how Nandi plays the Mridangam and Lord Ganesha plays the
              Nattuvangam and Lord Shiva dances Blissfully. Goddess Parvathi
              also enjoys his dance.

              ‘Magdalena Mariam’, is based on a renowned Malayalam poem by
              Mahakavi Vallathol Narayana Menon. It portrays a powerful moment
              from Mary Magdalene’s life — from being condemned as a sinner to
              finding redemption. As she is brought before Jesus to be stoned,
              He responds with compassion, urging the crowd that only one
              without sin may cast the first stone. The piece ends with Mary’s
              heartfelt repentance at His feet, symbolizing forgiveness, grace,
              and transformation.

              ‘Tarangam’ means waves and features stories from Lord Krishna’s
              life — his childhood, playful pranks, and marriage to Rukmini.
              This piece highlights Krishna’s divine beauty and the deep love of
              the gopis. It portrays the story of Krishna’s headache being cured
              by the dust of Radha’s feet, symbolizing her pure, selfless
              devotion.
